## PURPOSE

* Normally, R2 bucket can be created/deployed, configured, listed and deleted on the Cloudflare console or via Cloudflare CLI (Wrangler). <br>
    
* R2 bucket can also be deployed via AWS SDK in any language of choice, especially for those who: <br>
  1) Are already familiar with AWS SDK and <br>
  2) Want to create, configure, list and delete <strong>large number of buckets </strong> programatically.<br>
    
* <strong>This repository</strong> contains code for creating/deploying, configuring, listing and deleting cloudflare R2 bucket (object storage) via AWS SDK for JavaScript/NodeJS V3, from any computer. <br>
    
* AWS SDK for JavaScript/NodeJS V3 is clean, lightweight, fast and it fully supports the async-await syntax. <br>

* Also, cloudflare R2 bucket has <strong>lower storage cost </strong> and <strong> no egress fee </strong>, which makes it attractive to developers for object storage.
